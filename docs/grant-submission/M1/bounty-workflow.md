# Bounty workflow explanation

## Roles:

- Funder: who create and fund bounty.
- Hunter: who hunt bounty and work for the assigned bounty.
- Council: who review funders' bounty application and give feedback(yes or no). 

## A example workflow 

1. Alice(funder) create a bounty with 1000 native token funded, and waiting for the council to review.
2. The council review the bounty and give the review result(Yes or No).
3. Bob(hunter) can see the bounty and do hunting for the bounty.
4. Alice see the hunting for the bounty and assign the bounty to Bob.
5. Bob finish the work and do a submission for the bounty.
6. Alice resolve the bounty and give Bob 'Perfect' remark. Several things will happen:
    - Then 950 will be sent to Bob, while 50 will be sent to the council. 
    - Bob will get 2 times reputation added, one for resolving the bounty and another for the remark. 
    - Alice and Bob will get mining power. The total power will be decided by the fee the council got, and 90% of the power will be assigned to funder and 10% to hunter.
7. Bob give a 'Perfect' remark to Alice, and then Alice will get a reputation grow.
